JS committee didn't want that old codebase should be as use and throw because of writing new code , so even after the difference of arrow fn,classes & modules.

so when all code is treated as new js version code, a reference is required which engine will follows.

but by defining js it gets understood more to use new version.

when we have html binding and dev console binding alert(3+3) works.
but for nodejs different syntax is there these could have worked for browser.
