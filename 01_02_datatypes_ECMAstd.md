# difference b/w es5 old js(till 2015) & ECMA es6 modern js ?
# ES5
- primarily characterized by its use of function-based inheritance

- lack of advanced features like classes, arrow functions, and modules.

- Code written in old JavaScript can still be executed in modern browsers,

# ES6

ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later versions:-

- Classes: New JavaScript introduced classes as a cleaner and more concise way to define object-oriented structures. This replaced the need for function-based inheritance, making code more structured and readable.

- Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a concise way to create anonymous functions without the need for brackets and parentheses. They are commonly used for event handlers, callback functions, and higher-order functions.

- Modules: Modules introduced a way to organize code into reusable units, promoting code modularity and reusability. This helped to improve the maintainability and readability of large codebases.

- Promises: Promises are asynchronous data handlers that allow for chaining asynchronous operations and handling potential errors in a more organized manner. They simplify asynchronous programming and make it more manageable.

- Decorators: Decorators are a powerful feature that allows for metaprogramming, enabling the modification of classes and functions at runtime. They are primarily used for code injection and customization.
