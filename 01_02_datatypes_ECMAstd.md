# difference b/w es5 old js(till 2015) & ECMA es6 modern js ?
# ES5
- primarily characterized by its use of function-based inheritance

- lack of advanced features like classes, arrow functions, and modules.

- Code written in old JavaScript can still be executed in modern browsers,

# ES6

ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later versions:-

- Classes: For writing cleaner code in more concise way to define object-oriented structures. 

This replaced the need for function-based inheritance of old JS, as code is more structured and readable.

- Arrow Functions: to create anonymous functions without the need for brackets and parentheses used for event handlers, callback functions, and higher-order functions.

- Modules: a way to organize code into reusable units, promoting code modularity and reusability. It helps to improve maintenance and readability of large codebases.

- Promises: Promises are asynchronous data handlers that allow for chaining asynchronous operations and handling potential errors in a more organized manner. They simplify asynchronous programming and make it more manageable.

- Decorators: allows  metaprogramming:- enabling the modification of classes and functions at runtime. They are primarily used for code injection and customization.


# 'use strict' to consider code as new JS version

automatically also it is considered as new JS even if 'use strict' is not specified in beginning.

# the business need of the hour

However code is run via JS engine, so somehow standard of new version was enough as reference instead of whole app (code) written in older JS version being scrapped/wasted.

In Organization level, Cost Benifit Analysis is considered and cheap alternative is priotized. It's all cash, then all tech type situation.
